# RhythmConductor - Best Solo Hack at FraserHacks üéº

**RhythmConductor** is a passion project I created to bring the joy of conducting to everyone! The journey of building this tool was nothing short of amazing. From brainstorming how to mimic the gestures of a real conductor to testing it with my friends, every step was a blast.

## About the Project üé∂

The idea started as a fun way to combine my love for music with technology. I wanted to create something that could teach people the basics of conducting while making the experience interactive and enjoyable. Watching my friends wave their arms around and suddenly nail the perfect beat pattern was one of the highlights of this journey!

## Why I Loved Making It ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Collaborating with friends to test out features (and laughing at our initial attempts at conducting).
- Learning about the nuances of conducting and translating them into a digital format.
- Seeing the joy on people's faces as they "conducted" an orchestra for the first time.

This project brought so much joy to my life, and I hope it brings some to yours too!
